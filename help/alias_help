alias: alias
       Define or display aliases.

DESCRIPTION:
    The `alias` command allows you to define or display aliases. An alias is a
    short name or abbreviation that represents a longer command or sequence of
    commands.

USAGE:
    - Without arguments, `alias` prints the list of aliases in the reusable
      form `alias NAME=VALUE' on standard output.

    - When used with arguments, an alias is defined for each NAME whose VALUE
      is given. A trailing space in VALUE causes the next word to be checked
      for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.

OPTIONS:
    NONE

EXIT STATUS:
    - `alias` returns true (exit code 0) unless a NAME is supplied for which
      no alias has been defined.

EXAMPLES:
    - Display all defined aliases:
      $ alias

    - Define a new alias:
      $ alias myls='ls -F'
