cd: cd
    Change the shell's working directory.

    The `cd` command allows you to change the current directory in your shell.
    By default, if no directory is provided, it changes the current directory
    to the value stored in the HOME environment variable.

    You can provide a specific directory path as an argument to navigate to that
    location. The `CDPATH` environment variable defines a search path for the
    directory containing DIR. Multiple directory names in CDPATH are separated
    by colons (':'). A null directory name signifies the current directory.
    However, if DIR begins with a slash ('/'), CDPATH is not used.

    Options:
        -P: Sets the physical directory. Returns non-zero if unsuccessful.

    Exit Status:
        Returns 0 if the directory is changed successfully (or when using -P),
        non-zero otherwise.
